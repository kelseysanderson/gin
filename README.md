## Description
An app developed using the MERN stack. A user can login and play a game of gin rummy with another online player using websockets. The user will also be able to view their past game statistics.

## Installation
To install, clone this from my repository by entering `git clone https://github.com/rashidk83/project3.git` in a terminal in a new directory. Then, when successfully cloned, cd into the new folder and type `npm install`.

## Usage
Following installation, type `npm start` into the terminal in the newly created directory. This will open up the project locally in your browser. Make sure socket listener on line 10 of client/src/pages/Games/js is not commented out, and comment out line 11. Additionally there is a switch player button on lines 145 - 148 and 779 which can be helpful for testing.
